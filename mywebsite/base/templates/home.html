                <h4>Aspiring Software Engineer</h4>
                <hr>
                <p>After graduating university, I joined an independent software vendor specializing in enterprise software as junior software engineer. My tasks are not only coding, but also writing technical document such as requirements definition, basic designs, database design, etc (because Japanese companies only do waterfall). </p>
                <p>Currently I'm developing a Power Grid Asset Management System for an electric power company in Japan. It is a challenging task and put my electrical knowledge to a test.</p>
